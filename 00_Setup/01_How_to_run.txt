How to run a python Script ?

Simply Create a ".py" file with the desired operation.
ex :
    calculate.py
        print(1+1)
call the script :
python3 calculate.py

You can also specify the interpretor :
    calculate.py
            #!/bin/python3
            print(1+1)
call the script :
    ./calculate.py

"Main" is not mandatory as other language
in the example we had ti the script:
    calculate.py
            #!/bin/python3

            print(1+1)
            print(__name__)
            if __name__ == "__main__":
                print("Do IT")
The output will be :
    2
    do something
"__main__" was assigned to the variable "__name__" 
Because the interpretor is running the current file as the main programm
