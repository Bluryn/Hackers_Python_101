Set of instruction in python have their own Structure.
Python language is base on indentation.
Choose Tab or space or double space (In my case vscode automaticaly sets tabs)

If you mess your indetation syntax you'll get an error message

Python will interprate "\" as the continuity of one line if you backspace + tab ex:
    x = 1 + 2 \
        + 3
Indentation within a line does not matter.

Python build-in help on print function can be called with print( ... )
